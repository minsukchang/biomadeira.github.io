                    <p>I develop interaction techniques for <b>mining context in large-scale web data</b> to create/support learning opportunities in the wild. 
                       I study <b>computational representations</b> to structure the collective contexts mined, based on which I <b>build interfaces</b> for expanding people's abilities to search, analyze and make decisions to improve learning experiences.</p>

                    <p>I'm interested in the interaction bounds of interfaces, and the resulting strategic decisions users are forced to make. For example,
                        <ul>
                            <li>users having to go back and forth between search results of thousand items and individual page of one specific item.</li>
                            <li>users deciding whether to get the task done as fast as possible or invest time to learn how to do the task better.</li>
                            <li>users having to use hands for both controlling the video tutorial and the task at hand.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>I build alternative systems to these computationally bounded interfaces by leveraging interaction techniques, human computation, and machine learning. 
                        At the same time, I aim to leverage these situations to learn about <b>diverse explanations, reasonings, relationships between the choices users make</b> with a vision that they will not only expand what people can learn but also expand what machines can learn.</p>

                    <p>I also spend a lot of my time thinking about ways we can improve learning at scale (i.e. MOOC) with peer learning and with interactions that leverage peer dynamics.</p>

                    <p>I taught the lab sessions for <a href="https://cs101.kaist.ac.kr">Introduction to Programming</a> course from 2015-2018 as a Head TA. 
                    I enjoyed working with 40 TAs and interacting with 450-500 students each semester.</p>

            <p>I studied Computer Science, Financial Engineering from KAIST, Finance from Simon Business School @ University of Rochester, and Statistics
                from Rutgers University. I have worked at an Hedge Fund in NYC trying to beat the market by relentlessly crunching numbers prior to coming (back) to KAIST.
                I've spent two years in the reinforcement learning (as a subfield of machine learning) research group at KAIST as a Ph.D student before joining KIXLAB (the KAIST Interaction Lab).
