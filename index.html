            <h3><strong>Hi! :) My name is Minsuk Chang. </strong></h3>
            <p><a> I'm a PhD student in the <a href="cs.kaist.ac.kr"></a> School of Computing</a> at <a href="www.kaist.ac.kr"> KAIST </a>
                advised by <a href="juhokim.com"> Juho Kim </a>. I build interactive systems powered by statistical inference on large scale interaction data.
                I am an active member of <a href="kixlab.org"> KIXLAB </a>since its day one, and we're part of the bigger <a href="hci.kaist.ac.kr"> HCI @ KAIST</a> group.
            </p>
            <h5><strong> One-liner Research Objective </strong></h5>
            <p> I aim to build interfaces that promote learning for both humans and machines. </p>

            <h5><strong>What I do: </strong></h5>
            <p><ul>
            <li>I build interfaces using data-driven computational interaction models to support computationally rational user scenarios.</li>
            <li>I use human computation, machine learning and statistical inference on naturally crowdsourced instructions to mine human semantics layers like explanations, reasoning, consequences and causal relationships.</li>
            <li>I spend a lot of my time thinking about ways we can improve learning at scale through peer learning.</li>
            <li>I also like exploring under-explored statistical methods and probabilistic models that can assist scientific experiments in HCI.</li>
            <li>I'm a Head TA for the Introduction to Programming course since 2015. I really enjoy working with  40 TAs and interacting with 450-500 students each semester! </li>
