            <h3><strong>Hi :) My name is Minsuk Chang. </strong></h3>
            <p><a> I'm a <a href="https://cs.kaist.ac.kr">Computer Science</a> PhD student in the <a href="https://kixlab.org"> KIXLAB</a> at <a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr"> KAIST</a>
                advised by <a href="https://juhokim.com"> Juho Kim</a>. My work in HCI focuses on building interactive systems powered by statistical inference on large scale interaction data.
            </p>
            <h5><strong> One-liner Research Objective: </strong></h5>
            <p> I develop techniques for mining and organizing context in large-scale web data to create learning opportunities in the wild</p>

                    <p>I develop interaction techniques for <b>mining context in large-scale web data</b> to create/support <b>learning opportunities in the wild</b>. 
                       I study computational representations to organize the collective contextual information, based on which I build interfaces for <b>expanding people's abilities</b> to search, analyze and make decisions to improve learning experiences.</p>

                    <p>I'm interested in the <b>interaction bounds</b> which interfaces pose on users, and the <b>strategic decisions</b> users are forced to make. For example,
                        <ul>
                            <li>having to go back and forth between search results of thousand items and individual page of one specific item,</li>
                            <li>getting the work done as fast as possible vs investing time to learn how to properly do a task, </li>
                            <li>having to use hands for both controlling the video tutorial and the task at hand,</li>
                        </ul>
                        and more!
                    </p>

                    <p>I try to suggest alternatives for these computationally bounded interfaces by leveraging <b>interaction techniques, human computation, and machine learning.</b> 
                        At the same time, I aim to leverage these situations to learn about <b>diverse explanations, reasonings, relationships between the choices users make</b> with a vision that they will expand what machines can learn.</p>

                    <p>I also spend a lot of my time thinking about ways we can improve <b>learning at scale (i.e. MOOC)</b> with peer learning and with interactions that leverage peer dynamics.</p>

                    <p>I taught the lab sessions for <a href="https://cs101.kaist.ac.kr">Introduction to Programming</a> course from 2015-2018 as a Head TA. 
                    I enjoyed working with 40 TAs and interacting with 450-500 students each semester.</p>

            <p>I have training in Computer Science, Financial Engineering from KAIST, Finance from Simon Business School @ University of Rochester, and Statistics
                from Rutgers University. I have worked at an Hedge Fund in NYC trying to beat the market by relentlessly crunching numbers prior to coming (back) to KAIST.
                I've spent two years in the reinforcement learning (as a subfield of machine learning) research group at KAIST as a Ph.D student before joining KIXLAB (the KAIST Interaction Lab).
